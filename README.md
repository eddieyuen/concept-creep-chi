# concept_creep_chi
## Summary
This research aims to examine the phenomenon of harm-related concept creep within the Chinese context and to explore how ideological factors may influence the semantic expansion of different domains of concept. The diachronic word embeddings approach will be applied to the People’s Daily corpus to examine the temporal semantic changes of harm-related versus nationalism-related concepts in China. 

## Research Questions
1. Does the phenomenon of harm-related concept creep occur in the Chinese context?
2. How does the use of each moral foundation change over time in the Chinese context?
3. Is there a similar trend of concept creep for nationalism-related concepts in the Chinese context?
4. How does the cultural salience of each moral foundation influence the semantic breadth of each concept across time? Does the use of individualizing foundations predict harm-related concept creep, and does the use of binding foundations predict nationalism-related concept creep in the Chinese context?
5. How exactly have the meanings of harm-related and nationalism-related concepts changed over the past few decades in the Chinese context?

## Methods
- Word embeddings models for the corpus were trained using the word2vec algorithm in the ‘gensim’ package.
- Four harm-related concepts are selected as illustrative examples of the concept creep phenomenon in China: “prejudice,” “bullying,” “mental disorder,” and “trauma”.
- To explore whether concept creep extends outside of the political left, four nationalism-related concepts are chosen: “secession,” “conspiracy,” “sovereignty,” and “terrorism.”
- The simplified Chinese version of Moral Foundation Dictionary will be drawn as proxies of ideology.
